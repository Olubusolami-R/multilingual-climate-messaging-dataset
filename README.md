# Multilingual Climate Messaging Dataset (English, Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo)**

## Description

This dataset is a multilingual parallel corpus of 715 climate-related public messages in English, Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo. It was created to support inclusive climate communication and low-resource NLP research for African languages. The English messages were generated using AI-assisted, template-based prompts reflecting real-world scenarios such as flooding, heatwaves, and air pollution. Native speakers then translated each message into Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo, ensuring cultural and linguistic accuracy. These translations were also reviewed by external language professionals for quality assurance.

**Motivation**

The dataset was built to demonstrate how critical climate information can be made more accessible to non-English speakers in Nigeria. It also supports language technology development in low-resource African languages, offering a valuable resource for both practical and academic purposes. Through this dataset, we hope to set a precedent for the creation of similar datasets in other low-resourced Nigerian and African languages, promoting broader linguistic inclusivity in climate adaptation.
